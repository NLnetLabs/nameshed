  # Triggering on PRs and arbitrary branch pushes is not enabled because most of the time only the CI build should be
  # triggered, not the packaging build. In cases where you want to test changes to this workflow this trigger enables
  # you to manually invoke this workflow on an arbitrary branch as needed.
