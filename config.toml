# Configuring the Cascade daemon.
#
# This controls Cascade's behaviour as a daemon, i.e. how it interacts with the
# external system.
[daemon]
#
# Whether or not to fork the process and apply the pid-file, chroot and
# identity settings.

daemonize = false
#
# The minimum severity of the messages logged by the daemon.
#
# Messages at or above the specified severity level will be logged.  The
# following levels are defined:
# - 'trace': A function or variable was interacted with, for debugging.
# - 'debug': Something occurred that may be relevant to debugging.
# - 'info': Things are proceeding as expected.
# - 'warning': Something does not appear to be correct.
# - 'error': Something went wrong (but Cascade can recover).
# - 'critical': Something went wrong and Cascade can't function at all.

#
# The location the daemon writes logs to.
#
# Logs are appended line-by-line to the specified file path.  It can be set to
# '/dev/stdout' or '/dev/stderr' for standard output and error, respectively.
# If it is a terminal, ANSI escape codes may be used to style the output.

#
# The path to a PID file to maintain.

# If specified, Cascade will maintain a PID file at this location; it will be a
# simple plain-text file containing the PID number of the daemon process.
#
# Only applied if daemonize = true.

#
# A directory to chroot into after startup.
#
# Cascade will chroot into the specified directory after initialization.  Note
# that this will fail if Cascade is started without administrator privileges.
# 
# TODO: How will this affect the paths Cascade interacts with?  What if files
# aren't within the chroot - do we just fail?  Or do we interpret all paths here
# relative to the chroot?
#
# Only applied if daemonize = true.
#chroot = "/var/run/cascade"
#
# An identity (user and group) to assume after startup.
#
# Cascade will assume the specified identity after initialization.  Note that
# this will fail if Cascade is started without administrator privileges.
#
# The identity can be specified as '<user>:<group>' or just '<user>'; in the
# latter case, the identically named group will be used.  Both the user
# and group must be specified as a name, numeric IDs are NOT supported.
#
# Only applied if daemonize = true.

# Configuring how zones are loaded.

# Where to listen for zone change notifications.
#
# A DNS server will be bound to these addresses.  If a DNS NOTIFY message for a
# known zone is received there, the zone will be reloaded appropriately.
#
# Unless explicitly specified (e.g. 'udp://localhost:0000'), each address will
# be served over UDP and TCP.  An empty array will disable listening entirely.

# Configuring whether and how loaded zones are reviewed.

# Where to serve loaded zones for review.
#
# A DNS server will be bound to these addresses, and will serve the contents of
# all loaded zones.  This can be used to verify the consistency of these zones.
#
# Unless explicitly specified (e.g. 'udp://localhost:0000'), each address will
# be served over UDP and TCP.  An empty array will disable serving entirely.

# Configuring how zones are signed.

# Configuring whether and how signed zones are reviewed
[signer.review]
# Where to serve signed zones for review.
#
# A DNS server will be bound to these addresses, and will serve the contents of
# all signed zones.  This can be used to check the correctness of the signer.
#
# Unless explicitly specified (e.g. 'udp://localhost:0000'), each address will
# be served over UDP and TCP.  An empty array will disable serving entirely.

# Configuring how zones are published.
[server]
# Where to serve published zones.
# 
# A DNS server will be bound to these addresses, and will serve the contents of
# all published zones.  This is the final output from Cascade.
#
# Unless explicitly specified (e.g. 'udp://localhost:0000'), each address will
# be served over UDP and TCP.  At least one address must be specified.
