# Nameshed contains many performance-sensitive hashmaps and is not expected to
# be accessible to attackers.  'std's default hasher, which is slow but secure
# against HashDoS attacks, is not appropriate.  A performant, cryptographically
# insecure hash function is needed.
#
# - 'foldhash' is a fast, insecure, general-purpose hash function.

#   TODO: Who maintains it, and how well?
#
# - 'rustc-hash' is the hash function used by 'rustc'.  It trades hash quality
#   for performance, as best suites 'rustc'.
