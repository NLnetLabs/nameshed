Cascade
=======

A friendly DNSSEC signing solution written in Rust, a programming
language designed for performance and memory safety.

Flexibility
   Run Cascade the way that you want: from a package or a Docker image,
   on-premise or in the cloud, with keys on disk or an HSM of your
   choice.

Sensible defaults
   Get started easily with default settings based on industry 
   best practices. 

Controllability
   Cascade hives you tight control over the DNSSEC signing process and
   and offers validation hooks at each stage of the process. 

Observability
   With Cascade you cut out the guesswork. You will know what the
   pipeline is doing and why, and what you can expect to happen next.
